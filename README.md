📱 RoboVision – An Educational Android App for STEM Learning
🎯 Project Overview
RoboVision is a multimedia-rich Android application designed to teach schoolchildren how computers use computer vision techniques like color detection and image recognition. The app combines educational videos, games, and quizzes to promote STEM learning in a fun and interactive way.

📌 Key Features
🎥 Educational Video: Introduces basic computer vision concepts.

🎮 Drag-and-Match Game: Match icons (camera, robot, etc.) to their correct functions.

🎨 Color Detection Activity: Uses OpenCV to show how computers detect colors.

🧠 Quiz Module: Tests understanding with gamified multiple-choice questions.

🔊 Multimedia Feedback: Includes background music and sound effects for engagement.

🏆 Score System: Tracks progress and rewards correct answers.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Java

IDE: Android Studio

Libraries:

AndroidX (AppCompat, ConstraintLayout, etc.)

OpenCV (for color detection)

MediaPlayer (for audio feedback)

Version Control: GitHub

Multimedia Tools: Canva, Audacity, CapCut

🚀 How to Run the App
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Sharwin1707/RoboVision.git
Open in Android Studio

File > Open > Select the project folder.

Build & Run

Connect an Android device or emulator.

Click ▶️ "Run" to install and launch the app.

Permissions

No internet connection is required.

🧪 Testing Notes
All activities tested manually.

Transitions, audio playback, and scoring were debugged using Logcat.

Known issues were fixed during development (e.g., MediaPlayer lifecycle, image loading bugs).

📚 Educational Goal
The app is designed to support STEM education by:

Visualizing how robots "see" using cameras.

Encouraging exploration through play-based learning.

Reinforcing understanding via feedback-rich interaction.
